# ReadEasy
A real time on screen translation web app
While reading journals, research papers, books, comics from different parts of the world which are written in different languages, language acts as a barrier for many people. Many times these texts are present in pdfs and images and other formats which are not readily selectable or machine readable and can’t be copy pasted into translators. Hence, this becomes a rather annoying problem.
ReadEasy! is a web application software, which lets people overcome this problem by enabling them to get translated text in the language they are comfortable in, side by side as they read through the different foreign texts so that they don’t need to have dictionaries with them or type in translators and so having a smooth and comfortable reading experience.

1.1 The user will be able to take a tutorial of how the web app works by watching a small video. 

1.2 The user will be able to select the language they want the text to be translated into from several different languages.

1.3 The user will then receive the translated text on the browser itself and it will be in the same context the text was present in.
